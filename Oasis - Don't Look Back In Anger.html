    <p> Slip inside the eye of your mind <br/>
Don't you know you might find <br/>
A better place to play <br/>
You said that you'd never been <br/>
But all the things that you've seen <br/>
Slowly fade away <br/>
So I start a revolution from my bed <br/>
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head <br/>
Step outside, summertime's in bloom <br/>
Stand up beside the fireplace <br/>
Take that look from off your face <br/>
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out <br/>
<br/>
And so Sally can wait <br/>
She knows it's too late <br/>
As we're walking on by <br/>
Her soul slides away <br/>
But don't look back in anger <br/>
I heard you say <br/>
<br/>
Take me to the place where you go <br/>
Where nobody knows <br/>
If it's night or day <br/>
But please don't put your life in the hands <br/>
Of a rock and roll band <br/>
Who'll throw it all away <br/>
I'm gonna start a revolution from my bed <br/>
'Cause you said the brains I had went to my head <br/>
Step outside 'cause summertime's in bloom <br/>
Stand up beside the fireplace <br/>
Take that look from off your face <br/>
'Cause you ain't ever gonna burn my heart out <br/>
<br/>
And so Sally can wait <br/>
She knows it's too late <br/>
As she's walking on by <br/>
My soul slides away <br/>
But don't look back in anger <br/>
I heard you say <br/>
<br/>
So Sally can wait <br/>
She knows it's too late <br/>
As we're walking on by <br/>
Her soul slides away <br/>
But don't look back in anger <br/>
I heard you say <br/>
<br/>
So Sally can wait <br/>
She knows it's too late <br/>
As she's walking on by <br/>
My soul slides away <br/>
But don't look back in anger <br/>
Don't look back in anger <br/>
I heard you say <br/>
At least not today <br/>
