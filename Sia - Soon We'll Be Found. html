<h1> Sia - Soon We'll Be Found </h1>

<p> Come along it is the break of day <br/>
Surely now, you'll have some things to say <br/>
It's not the time for telling tales on me <br/>
So come along, it wont be long <br/>
'Til we return happy <br/>
Shut your eyes, there are no lies <br/>
In this world we call sleep <br/>
Let's desert this day of hurt <br/>
Tomorrow we'll be free <br/>
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight? <br/>
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say <br/>
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
Well it's been rough but we'll be just fine <br/>
Work it out yeah we'll survive <br/>
You mustn't let a few bad times dictate <br/>
So come along, it wont be long <br/>
'Til we return happy <br/>
Shut your eyes, there are no lies <br/>
In this world we call sleep <br/>
Let's desert this day of work <br/>
Tomorrow we'll be free <br/>
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight? <br/>
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say <br/>
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
(I know we're lost but soon we'll be found) <br/>
Oh <br/>
Yeah, oh <br/>
Oh <br/>
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight? <br/>
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say <br/>
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
Oh <br/>
Let's not fight, I'm tired, can't we just sleep tonight? <br/>
Don't turn away, it's just there's nothing left here to say <br/>
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
(I know we're lost but soon we'll be found) <br/>
Let's not fight, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
Don't turn away I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
(I know we're lost but soon we'll be found) <br/>
Let's not fight, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
Don't turn away, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
Turn around, I know we're lost but soon we'll be found <br/>
