Coming out of my cage<br/>
And I've been doing just fine<br/>
Gotta gotta be down<br/>
Because I want it all<br/>
It started out with a kiss<br/>
How did it end up like this?<br/>
It was only a kiss<br/>
It was only a kiss<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm falling asleep<br/>
And she's calling a cab<br/>
While he's having a smoke<br/>
And she's taking the drag<br/>
<br/>
Now they're going to bed<br/>
And my stomach is sick<br/>
And it's all in my head<br/>
But she's touching his chest now<br/>
<br/>
He takes off her dress now<br/>
Let me go<br/>
And I just can't look<br/>
It's killing me<br/>
And taking control<br/>
<br/>
Jealousy<br/>
Turning saints into the sea<br/>
Swimming through sick lullaby<br/>
Choking on your alibi<br/>
But it's just the price I pay<br/>
Destiny is calling me<br/>
Open up my eager eyes<br/>
I'm Mr. Brightside<br/>
<br/>
