	<p> So am I still waiting <br/>
		For this world to stop hating <br/>
		Can't find a good reason <br/>
		Can't find hope to believe in <br/>
		<br/>
		Drop dead a bullet to my head <br/>
		Your words are like a gun in hand <br/>
		You can't change the state of the nation <br/>
		We just need some motivation <br/>
		Three times casino eviction <br/>
		Just lies and more contradiction <br/>
		<br/>
		So tell me what would you say <br/>
		I'd say its up, to me <br/>
		<br/>
		So am I still waiting <br/>
		For this world to stop hating <br/>
		Can't find a good reason <br/>
		Can't find hope to believe in <br/>
		<br/>
		Ignorance and Understanding <br/>
		We're the first ones to jump in line <br/>
		Out of step for what we believe in <br/>
		But who's left? To start the pleading <br/>
		How far will we take this <br/>
		It's not hard to see through the sickness             <br/>
 		<br/>
		So tell me what you would say <br/>
		I'd say its up, to me <br/>
		<br/>
		So am I still waiting <br/>
		For this world to stop hating <br/>
		Can't find a good reason <br/>
		Can't find hope to believe in <br/>
		<br/>
		This can't last forever <br/>
		Time won't make things better <br/>
		I feel so alone <br/>
		Can't help myself <br/>
		And no one knows <br/>
		If this is worthless <br/>
		Tell me, so <br/>
		<br/>
		What have we done <br/>
		We're in a war that can't be won <br/>
		This can't be real <br/>
		I don't know what to feel <br/>
		<br/>
		So am I still waiting <br/>
		For this world to stop hating <br/>
		Can't find a good reason <br/>
		Can't find hope to believe in <br/>
		<br/>
		So am I still waiting <br/>
		For this world to stop hating <br/>
		Can't find a good reason <br/>
		Can't find hope to believe in <br/>
