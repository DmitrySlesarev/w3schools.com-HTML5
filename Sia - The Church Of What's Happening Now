I want to change, to rearrange <br/>
What is going on <br/>
I need to change, I need to play <br/>
Like a five year old <br/>
<br/>
I can't detach from the past and all of the pain <br/>
I need to learn, start from scratch begin again <br/>
<br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
<br/>
So I'm going to eat one hundred sweets <br/> 
I don't care if I get fat <br/>
And I'm going to speak one I won't censor me <br/>
I know I can take nothing back <br/>
<br/>
And I'm going to jump I will unburden <br/>
I cannot go too deep <br/>
I will not run from bad things I've done <br/>
They're things I'll try not to repeat <br/>
<br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to <br/>
The church of what's happening now <br/>
Head straight through <br/>
It costs nothing but change <br/>
<br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
<br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
<br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
Throw away yesterday <br/>
Today is a brand new day <br/>
<br/>
