	<h1> Slipknot - Wait And Bleed. </h1>
	<p> I've felt the hate rise up in me <br/>
		Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <br/>
		I wander out where you can't see <br/>
		Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <br/>
		<br/>
		I've felt the hate rise up in me <br/>
		Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <br/>
		I wander out where you can't see <br/>
		Inside my shell, I wait and bleed <br/>
		<br/>
		Goodbye! <br/>
		<br/>
		I wipe it off on tile, the light is brighter this time <br/>
		Everything is 3D blasphemy <br/>
		My eyes are red and gold, the hair is standing straight up <br/>
		This is not the way I pictured me <br/>
		I can't control my shakes, how the hell did I get here? <br/>
		Something about this, so very wrong <br/>
		I have to laugh out loud, I wish I didn't like this <br/>
		Is it a dream or a memory? <br/>
		<br/>
		I've felt the hate rise up in me <br/>
		Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <br/>
		I wander out where you can't see <br/>
		Inside my shell I wait and bleed <br/>
		<br/>
		Get outta my head 'cause I don't need this, why didn't I see this? <br/>
		But I am a victim, Manchurian candidate <br/>
		I have sinned by just <br/>
		Making my mind and taking your breath away <br/>
		<br/>
		I've felt the hate rise up in me <br/>
		Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <br/>
		I wander out where you can't see <br/>
		Inside my shell I wait and bleed <br/>
		<br/>
		I've felt the hate rise up in me <br/>
		Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <br/>
		I wander out where you can't see <br/>
		Inside my shell I wait and bleed <br/>
		<br/>
		Goodbye! <br/>
		<br/>
		You haven't learned a thing <br/>
		I haven't changed a thing <br/>
		The flesh was in my bones <br/>
		The pain was always free <br/>
		<br/>
		You haven't learned a thing <br/>

		<br/>
		I've felt the hate rise up in me <br/>
		Kneel down and clear the stone of leaves <br/>
		I wander out where you can't see <br/>
		Inside my shell, I wait and bleed, uh! <br/>
		<br/>
		And it waits for you <br/>
