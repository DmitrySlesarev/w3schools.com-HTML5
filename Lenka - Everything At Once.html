	<h1> Lenka - Everything At Once. </h1>
    <p> *** </p>
	<p> As sly as a fox, as strong as an ox <br/>
		As fast as a hare, as brave as a bear <br/>
		As free as a bird, as neat as a word <br/>
		As quite as a mouse, as big as a house <br/>
		<br/>
		All I wanna be, all I wanna be, oh
		All I wanna be is everything
		<br/>
		As mean as wolf, as sharp as a tooth <br/>
		As deep as a bite, as dark as the night <br/>
		As sweet as a song, as right as a wrong <br/>
		As long as a road, as ugly as a toad <br/>
		<br/>
		As pretty as a picture hanging from a fixure <br/>
		Strong like a family, strong as I wanna be <br/>
		Bright as day, as light as play <br/>
		As hard as nails, as grand as a whale <br/>
		<br/>
		All I wanna be, oh, all I wanna be, oh <br/>
		All I wanna be is everything <br/>
		Everything at once <br/>
		Everything at once, oh <br/>
		Everything at once <br/>
		<br/>
		As warm as the sun, as silly as fun <br/>
		As cool as a tree, as scary as the see <br/>
		As hot as fire, cold as ice <br/>
		Sweet as sugar and everything nice <br/>
		<br/>
		As old as time, as straight as line <br/>
		As royal as a queen, as buzzed as a bee <br/>
		As stealth as a tiger, smooth as a glider <br/>
		Pure as a melody, pure as I wanna be <br/>
		<br/>
		All I wanna be oh, all I wanna be, oh <br/>
		All I wanna be is everything <br/>
		Everything at once <br/>
        <p>***</p>
