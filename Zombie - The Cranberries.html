	<h1> 'Zombie' By The Cranberries. </h1>
	<p> Another head hangs lowly <br/>
    Child is slowly taken<br/>
    And the violence, caused such silence<br/>
    Who are we mistaken?<br/>
    <br/>
    But you see, it's not me<br/>
    It's not my family<br/>
    In your head, in your head, they're fighting<br/>
    With their tanks, and their bombs<br/>
    And their bombs, and their guns<br/>
    In your head, in your head they are crying<br/>
    <br/>
    In your head, in your head<br/>
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br/>
    What's in your head, in your head<br/>
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh<br/>
    <br/>
    Du, du, du, du<br/>
    Du, du, du, du<br/>
    Du, du, du, du<br/>
    Du, du, du, du<br/>
    <br/>
    Another mother's breaking<br/>
    Heart is taking over<br/>
    When the silence causes silence<br/>
    We must be mistaken<br/>
    <br/>
    It's the same old theme<br/>
    Since nineteen-sixteen<br/>
    In your head, in your head, they're still fighting<br/>
    With their tanks, and their bombs<br/>
    And their bombs, and their guns<br/>
    In your head, in your head they're dying<br/>
    <br/>
    In your head, in your head<br/>
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br/>
    What's in your head, in your head<br/>
    Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br/>
    Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, ay, oh, ya ya
</body>
